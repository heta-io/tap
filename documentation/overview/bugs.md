## Submitting bugs and suggestions

Please use [GitHub issues](../../issues) to notify us of a bug or to request a new feature. Before adding a new request, *please* search the existing issues to see if there is one the same or similar to yours. If so, add a [reaction](//github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) (like :+1: or :-1:) to the issue and post any additional relevant comments that will be helpful.

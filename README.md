# Text Analytics Pipeline (TAP)

TAP provides Text Analytics services via a [GraphQL API](). It is written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org), and uses the [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com), [Sangria GraphQL](http://sangria-graphql.org) and [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).
TAP currently provides back-end analytics services for:
 - [AcaWriter](https://acawriter.uts.edu.au), a web application for Academic Writing Analytics
 - [GoingOK](http://goingok.hi2lab.io), a web application for collecting and analysing personal reflective writing
 - [Metacognition Discovery](http://hi2lab.io/metacognition/)
 - A variety of Jupyter Notebooks used for tutoring in Text Analytics

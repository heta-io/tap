# Text Analytics Pipeline (TAP)

TAP provides Text Analytics services via a [GraphQL API](). It is written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org), and uses the [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com), [Sangria GraphQL](http://sangria-graphql.org) and [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).
TAP also provides back-end analytics services for [AWA](http://awa.uts.edu.au), a web application for Academic Writing Analytics.

### Get started with Docker

#### Docker for Windows 10
@@@ note { title=Notice }
Docker for Windows requires:

Windows 10 64bit: Pro, Enterprise or Education (1607 Anniversary Update, Build 14393 or later).

Virtualization is enabled in BIOS. Typically, virtualization is enabled by default. This is different from having Hyper-V enabled. For more detail see [Virtualization must be enabled](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled) in Troubleshooting.

CPU SLAT-capable feature.

At least 4GB of RAM.
@@@

**If you do not have windows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education, Please use [Docker Toolbox](#docker-toolbox).**

This is the easiest way to get started with docker and TAP. Windows 10 has an app called Docker For Windows which will handle everything automatically for you.
See [How To install Docker For Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

1. Ensure you have docker for windows installed and it is running.
2. First, quickly create a virtual switch for your virtual machine (VM) to use, so they can use your network adapter.
   
    * Launch Hyper-V Manager
    * Click Virtual Switch Manager in the right-hand menu
    * Click Create Virtual Switch of type External
    * Give it the name "myswitch", and check the box to share your host machine’s active network adapter
    
    ![switch creation](https://i.imgur.com/zgt6jYd.png)
  
3. Now create a VM we can use to run TAP on. (You may need to run this in admin, press windows key + x > Command Prompt (Admin))

        docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-memory 2048  --hyperv-virtual-switch "myswitch" myvm1
        
    Notice we are passing in some custom variables

    * We are giving it 2gb of ram 
    * We are choosing the switch we just created "myswitch"
    * We are naming it "myvm1"

4.  Once it is created, verify that it is running and write down it's IP. (here mine is 10.1.1.190)
        
        docker-machine ls
        
    ![docker machine ip](https://i.imgur.com/OSIfVV4.png)
        
5. To control your newly created docker machine there is a simple command you can run

        docker-machine env myvm1
        
    ![docker env](https://i.imgur.com/0Xumdot.png)
        
    This will return a command you can run in order to automatically send your docker commands to your vm. (the last line minus the REM)

    **Yours may be different than mine, be sure to run whatever command your terminal returns.**

    run that command
        
        @FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker-machine env myvm1') DO @%i
        
    Now any docker commands we run will run on the machine we created! Now let's get TAP running.

6. run docker run and pass in a number of parameters

        docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx6000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M" -e TAP_HOSTS="10.1.1.190:9000" -e TAP_SECRET="test" -p 9000:9000 andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2
        
    There are a few parameters here:
   
    * JAVA_OPTS is passing in our custom java environment variables which allow us to increase the amount of memory the application can use.
    * TAP_HOSTS is telling our application which IP is authorised to use our application, In this case you need to pass in your machine IP you wrote down earlier. In my case it is 10.1.1.190:9000
    * TAP_SECRET is a secret variable we can pass through to our application to ensure we are allowed to run the image. in this case just include "test"
    * -p tells the docker machine which port to use, So we are mapping our Port 9000 to the machines port 9000
    * lastly we include the docker image name in this case is "andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2" (3.2.2 is the version number, which may change at a later date. be sure to use the latest available)

7. That's it! if all went well, The docker should mention `factorie-nlp-api - Completed in xms` and you should be able to access your TAP instance by navigating to your Docker IP in a browser! (in my case 10.1.1.190:9000)

#### Docker for Mac

@@@ note { title=Notice }

Mac hardware must be a 2010 or newer model, with Intel’s hardware support for memory management unit (MMU) virtualization, including Extended Page Tables (EPT) and Unrestricted Mode. You can check to see if your machine has this support by running the following command in a terminal: sysctl kern.hv_support

MacOS El Capitan 10.11 and newer macOS releases are supported. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of macOS.

At least 4GB of RAM

VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30 must NOT be installed (it is incompatible with Docker for Mac). If you have a newer version of VirtualBox installed, it’s fine.

@@@

**If you do not have a late enough Mac model Please use [Docker Toolbox](#docker-toolbox).**

This is the easiest way to get started with docker and TAP. Late models of Mac have an app called Docker For Mac which will handle everything automatically for you.
See [How To install Docker For Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

1. Ensure you have docker for mac installed and it is running.
2. Ensure you have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) version 5+ installed on your system 
3. Now create a VM we can use to run TAP on.

        docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 2048  myvm1
        
    Notice we are passing in some custom variables

    * We are giving it 2gb of ram 
    * We are naming it "myvm1"

4.  Once it is created, verify that it is running and write down it's IP. (here mine is 192.168.99.100)
        
        docker-machine ls
        
    ![docker machine ip](https://i.imgur.com/8Dz2c6e.png)
        
5. To control your newly created docker machine there is a simple command you can run

        docker-machine env myvm1
        
    ![docker env](https://i.imgur.com/UfKaMT9.png)
        
    This will return a command you can run in order to automatically send your docker commands to your vm. (the last line minus the REM)

    **Yours may be different than mine, be sure to run whatever command your terminal returns.**

    run that command
        
        eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)
        
    Now any docker commands we run will run on the machine we created! Now let's get TAP running.

6. run docker run and pass in a number of parameters

        docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx6000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M" -e TAP_HOSTS="192.168.99.100:9000" -e TAP_SECRET="test" -p 9000:9000 andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2
        
    There are a few parameters here:
   
    * JAVA_OPTS is passing in our custom java environment variables which allow us to increase the amount of memory the application can use.
    * TAP_HOSTS is telling our application which IP is authorised to use our application, In this case you need to pass in your machine IP you wrote down earlier. In my case it is 192.168.99.100:9000
    * TAP_SECRET is a secret variable we can pass through to our application to ensure we are allowed to run the image. in this case just include "test"
    * -p tells the docker machine which port to use, So we are mapping our Port 9000 to the machines port 9000
    * lastly we include the docker image name in this case is "andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2" (3.2.2 is the version number, which may change at a later date. be sure to use the latest available)

7. That's it! if all went well, The docker should mention `factorie-nlp-api - Completed in xms` and you should be able to access your TAP instance by navigating to your Docker IP in a browser! (in my case 192.168.99.100:9000)

#### Docker ToolBox 

Ensure you have installed Docker Toolbox

[Install Docker Toolbox for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)

[Install Docker Toolbox for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/)

**When installing Docker Toolbox, Ensure you install VirtualBox and Git, To ensure the program works correctly.**

Once you have Docker Toolbox running and have run the Quick Setup Icon it created you should have this screen.
![docker ready](https://i.imgur.com/UK8jLl3.png)


1. Firstly let's remove the default docker machine, as we need to create one with 2gb memory.

        docker-machine rm default
        
    ![remove machine](https://i.imgur.com/9cbCH3f.png)
    
2. Great, Let's create a new one and pass in some custom parameters

        docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory=2048 myvm1
        
    This created a new machine called "myvm1" and gives it 2gb of ram instead of the default 1gb.
    
3. Great! let's get our docker machine IP.

        docker-machine ls
    
    ![dm ls](https://i.imgur.com/X4NdtNS.png)   
    
    My ip in this case would be 192.168.99.100 
    
4. Now we want to control our docker machine
        
        docker-machine env myvm1
        
    this will return a command we can run to set our machine as the active environment.       
    
    ![docker env](https://i.imgur.com/AaN1ntr.png)
    
    The last line is what we want, copy and paste it to set this machine as active.
    
            eval $("C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox\docker-machine.exe" env myvm1)   
            
5. Now we can start our Tap Image.
        
        docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx6000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M" -e TAP_HOSTS="192.168.99.100:9000" -e TAP_SECRET="test" -p 9000:9000 andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2
    
    There are a few parameters here:
       
    * JAVA_OPTS is passing in our custom java environment variables which allow us to increase the amount of memory the application can use.
    * TAP_HOSTS is telling our application which IP is authorised to use our application, In this case you need to pass in your machine IP you wrote down earlier. In my case it is 192.168.99.100:9000
    * TAP_SECRET is a secret variable we can pass through to our application to ensure we are allowed to run the image. in this case just include "test"
    * -p tells the docker machine which port to use, So we are mapping our Port 9000 to the machines port 9000
    * lastly we include the docker image name in this case is "andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2" (3.2.2 is the version number, which may change at a later date. be sure to use the latest available)
        
    Once that runs it will automatically download everything you require and then let you know it is running with `[info] factorie-nlp-api - Completed in xxxxx ms`
    
6. That's it! TAP is now running in a docker machine, You should be able to use TAP in the browser by navigating to you machine IP with the port 9000

    **In my case i would navigate to 192.168.99.100:9000**
    ![browser](https://i.imgur.com/KLQIn6n.png) 
    
    **If there are any issues with this documentation, or you wish to suggest changes, [open an issue](https://github.com/heta-io/tap/issues).**   
    
#### Docker CE for Linux

Ensure you have installed Docker CE

They have instructions for several versions of linux, Ensure you follow the instructions for your particular version of linux.

[Installing Docker CE on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

Ensure you have installed Docker Machine

[Install docker machine on linux](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/#install-machine-directly)

Ensure you have installed Oracle VirtualBox for linux

[VirtualBox Instructions](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

1. Create a Virtual Machine to run our docker container.

        docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory=2048 myvm1
        
2. run `docker-machine ls` to get the IP of our new machine.

    ![linux dm ls](https://i.imgur.com/02pce0v.png)
    
    In my case the IP is 192.168.99.100. Let's write that down for later.
    
3. We need to set our new docker machine as our active environment.

        docker-machine env myvm1
    
    ![linux dm env](https://i.imgur.com/WOB0679.png)
    
    This will return a command we can run which will set our environment to the active docker machine.
    Copy and paste the last line into your terminal.
    
        eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)
    Now any docker commands we run will run on the docker machine.
    
4. Run our TAP image.
        
        docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx6000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M" -e TAP_HOSTS="192.168.99.100:9000" -e TAP_SECRET="test" -p 9000:9000 andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2
        
    There are a few parameters here:
           
    * JAVA_OPTS is passing in our custom java environment variables which allow us to increase the amount of memory the application can use.
    * TAP_HOSTS is telling our application which IP is authorised to use our application, In this case you need to pass in your machine IP you wrote down earlier. In my case it is 192.168.99.100:9000
    * TAP_SECRET is a secret variable we can pass through to our application to ensure we are allowed to run the image. in this case just include "test"
    * -p tells the docker machine which port to use, So we are mapping our Port 9000 to the machines port 9000
    * lastly we include the docker image name in this case is "andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2" (3.2.2 is the version number, which may change at a later date. be sure to use the latest available)
            
    Great once that completes you should see the message `[info] factorie-nlp-api - Completed in xxxxx ms`

5. That's it! you should be good to go. You can now access the TAP instance by navigating to your machine ip in your browser with the port 9000
    
    **In my case that would 192.168.99.100:9000**
    
    ![linux browser](https://i.imgur.com/RUzxqch.png)
    
    **If there are any issues with this documentation, or you wish to suggest changes, [open an issue](https://github.com/heta-io/tap/issues).**
    
    

#### Run Docker on Digital Ocean

Digital Ocean offers a 1 click Docker Droplet that is capable of running TAP for $10 a month.

use this referral code to receive $10 in free credit upon signing up and adding a payment method. 
    
    https://m.do.co/c/694c2ae2c08b
    
1. Once you have an account Create a new Project to use for TAP.
    ![do create](https://i.imgur.com/506Ew2B.png)
    
    Once created, Click Create > Droplet
    ![do droplet create](https://i.imgur.com/36rGJfQ.png)
    
    Choose Docker and change the size to the $10 droplet.
    ![do droplet size](https://i.imgur.com/DC9xTyw.png)
    
    Disable backups, and choose a datacenter that is closest to you.
    ![do backups](https://i.imgur.com/bDWPhVz.png)
    
    Add an SSH key or use your existing one. See [here for instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/to-account/) on this.
    
    Finally give it a name you will recognize and choose the project you created.
    ![do create](https://i.imgur.com/G487S6n.png)
    
    Then click create.
    
    It may take a few minutes to setup.
    
2. There are 2 ways we can "talk" to our new droplet.
    
    We can use the built in console (requires setting up a root password) Or we can use our ssh key and a client called Putty.

    To connect with Putty follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/putty/)
    
    To Set a Root Password and use the console follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-console/)
    
3. Once you are logged in on your droplet you should have a command line in front of you.

4. We need to add a swapfile to enable enough ram to get java running.

    Run the following command to add a swap file.

        sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
    
    let's lock down the swap file so no one else can use it
        
        sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
    
    verify that it's permissions are correct by typing
    
        ls -lh /swapfile
        
    You should see the following
    
    ![swap perms](https://i.imgur.com/l5TpRWf.png)
    
    Great, Now mark it as swap so we can actually use it
        
        sudo mkswap /swapfile
        
    Now we can enable it
        
        sudo swapon /swapfile
        
    **please note this will be removed if you restart the server. 
    If you wish to make it permanent please see the following guide [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-18-04)**
        
5. Great now we can run the following command to setup your droplet.

    **Please note you need to replace DROPLET-IP with the IP of your droplet.**
    
        docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx6000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M" -e TAP_HOSTS="DROPLET-IP:9000" -e TAP_SECRET="test" -p 9000:9000 andrewresearch/tap:3.2.2
        
    That's it! You should be up and running and now can access your Tap Client from the browser by typing in your Droplet IP and adding the port.
    
        DROPLET-IP:9000

### Get started locally without Docker

1. First clone the project source code with git:

        git clone https://github.com/heta-io/tap
        
2. Ensure you have the [latest sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org) installed

3. Create a file called ```LocalSbtSettings.scala``` in the /project directory. This will hold your specific settings for your build:
   
        import sbt._
        
        object LocalSbtSettings {
         val githubBaseUrl = "https://github.com/heta-io/tap" //Change this to your fork
         val scaladocApiBaseUrl = "https://heta-io.github.io/tap/" //Change this to your fork
         val dockerRepoURI = "the.url.to.publish.docker.images.to" //leave as is if not using docker
        }
        
4. Now we need to setup some variables.
